/// servers routinely put the access token in that query, Jellyfin's `api_key=` being the case this was
/// written for, so those lines carry a live credential into `os.Logger` (a Console.app capture, a
/// sysdiagnose) and into whatever handler the host installed for its own in-app log.
///
/// A credential does not always arrive next to a name, and that half was reported from the field: some
/// debrid and proxy add-ons carry the account token in a PATH segment, as base64url-encoded JSON, where
/// nothing in the URL names it. The list of names cannot be extended to reach that one, because the
/// names live inside the payload, so the encoding itself has to be the signal (`encodedPayloadRange`).
///
/// IPTV panels speaking the Xtream Codes API put the account's password in the path with no name and
/// no encoding at all (`/live/{user}/{password}/{id}.ts`), so the layout is the only signal there
/// (`xtreamPathSecretRange`). Its short form (`/{user}/{password}/{id}`) has no layout to go by, and
/// neither does a provider shape nobody has reported yet; for those the host names the value itself
/// through `EngineLog.registerSecret(_:)`, which is matched literally (`registeredSecretRange`).
